# Presentations

Slide decks by [Rural Hackers](https://ruralhackers.com) and the [Anceu Coliving](https://anceu.com) team.

Each presentation lives in its own folder as a self-contained HTML slide deck -- no build tools, no dependencies, just open `index.html` in a browser.

## Presentations

| Talk | Folder | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **Do What You Love: Side Projects as Organic Marketing** | [`side-projects/`](side-projects/) | How passion-driven side projects became Anceu Coliving's most effective marketing channel. Covers Hacker Days, Fuchiqueiras, Entre Culturas, and Pegadas do Recordo. |

## Usage

Open any presentation directly in your browser:

```bash
# From the repo root
open side-projects/index.html
```

Navigate slides with arrow keys, spacebar, or by clicking/tapping.

## Adding a new presentation

1. Create a new folder at the root (e.g. `my-talk/`).
2. Add an `index.html` with your slides and any assets in an `images/` subfolder.
3. Update this README with a new row in the table above.
